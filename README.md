# Gui exercises

This is the last set of exercises I will do about core Java, the aim will be to create GUI interfaces (even tough I doubt it'll help me in web development I guess it's a valid way to learn something new). As always, the source for these exercises will be the MOOC of the University of Helsinki.

## Exercises
